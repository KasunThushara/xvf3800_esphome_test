# ESPHome components and example config for [Respeaker XVF3800](https://github.com/respeaker/reSpeaker_XVF3800_USB_4MIC_ARRAY)

## _ATTENTION! Under development, use on your own risk!_
## Testing appreciated.

## Known issues:
1. There's no buttons, so no way to stop timer or response except saying "stop", and no way to start pipeline manually.
2. No volume controls besides the software one (similar to Respeaker Lite Voice Kit).
3. No exposed light (LED is controlled via I2C).
4. ...?
